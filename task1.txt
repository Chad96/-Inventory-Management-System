Requirement Analysis and Functional Design
Requirement Analysis
The small retail business requires an inventory management system to streamline operations. The key functionalities needed are:
* Product Management: Ability to add, update, and delete product information (e.g., product ID, name, description, price).
* Stock Tracking: Monitor stock levels for each product and update quantities based on sales or restocking.
* Restock Notifications: Alert the user when stock levels fall below a predefined threshold (e.g., 10 units).
* Sales Tracking: Record sales transactions, including product sold, quantity, and date.
* Sales Reporting: Generate reports summarizing sales over the last 30 days.
* Supplier Management: Maintain supplier details and link products to suppliers for restocking purposes.
The system should be user-friendly, scalable, and maintainable, with a simple interface for retail staff to manage inventory and generate reports.
